# Odin Recipes

This is a basic HTML project built as part of The Odin Project curriculum.  
In this project, I will create a simple recipe website using only HTML.  

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:
- Creating and structuring HTML files
- Using elements like headings, lists, images, and links
- Building multiple pages and linking them together
